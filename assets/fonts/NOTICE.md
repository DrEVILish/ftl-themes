# Font notices (`assets/fonts/`)

Companion to `docs/icon-license-research.md` and `assets/logos/README.md` —
same idea, different asset class: this records what was actually checked
about each vendored font's license, rather than assuming "it's on Google
Fonts, so it must be SIL OFL" uniformly across every family. Each entry
below was verified against that family's own Google Fonts listing (and,
for the ones mirrored in the `google/fonts` GitHub repo, its `ofl/`
directory placement — Google Fonts sorts fonts into `ofl/`, `apache/` or
`ufl/` by license, so the directory itself is a second confirmation
alongside the specimen page's license line).

All files vendored here except Bedstead (CC0) and Px437 IBM VGA 9x16 (CC BY-SA 4.0), both below, turned out to be **SIL Open Font License,
version 1.1** — but that was verified per family below, not assumed.
OFL 1.1 permits embedding, bundling and redistributing the font (including
as a webfont, including verbatim, including at whatever scale this
library is redistributed to consuming apps) without requiring per-use or
per-page attribution — the one hard restriction is that the font may not
be **sold by itself**, on its own, separate from software; that doesn't
apply to embedding it in a theme's CSS bundle. Reserved font names must
not be reused by a modified version, which is moot here since these
files are vendored unmodified.

## Bottom line

Twelve files, eleven families: nine SIL OFL 1.1, Bedstead CC0 and Px437
CC BY-SA 4.0, all verified per family rather than assumed from "it's on
Google Fonts." Attribution is optional under
OFL (unlike, say, CC BY), but is included here anyway for the same
diligence reasons `docs/icon-license-research.md` and
`assets/logos/README.md` document their sources: so "we checked" isn't
just asserted from memory, and so a future addition to this directory has
a template to follow instead of reinventing the check.
